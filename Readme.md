# luminos

This is a Laravel inspired set of tools for applications. They can be used independently or together.

This crate re-exports the following sub crates to provide a unified api.

- [luminos-Contracts](https://github.com/RaubJo/luminos-contracts)
- [luminos-support](https://github.com/RaubJo/luminos-support)
- [luminos-container](https://github.com/RaubJo/luminos-container)
- [luminos-config](https://github.com/RaubJo/luminos-config)

The goal of this is provide a simple way to build runtime agnostic rust apps.

- Tauri
- Web (Rocket, Axum, Actix, etc.)
